# Crime Analysis in Vancouver (2003-2023)

## Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of crime data in Vancouver spanning from 2003 to 2023. The analysis aims to uncover temporal and spatial trends in crime, providing insights that can be valuable for law enforcement, urban planning, and community safety.

## Project Details
- **Objective:** Analyze crime data in Vancouver to identify patterns and trends.
- **Tools and Libraries:** Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Visualizations:** Creating line plots, bar charts, and an interactive city map.

## Getting Started
To run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the analysis:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).(some requirements may differ due to mac and windows)
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`crime_analysis.ipynb`).

## Data Source
The crime data used in this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tcashion/vancouver-bc-crime-dataset/data). It includes information about crime types, dates, locations, and other relevant details.

## Methodology
The analysis follows a systematic approach:
1. Data Loading and Inspection.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with temporal and spatial visualizations.
4. Key Findings and Insights.

## Key Findings
- Crime count initially was high around 2003 and continuously decreased until 2011.
- A subsequent increase occurred after 2011, with a peak in 2019 and a sudden dip in 2021.
- Significant crime activity observed around midnight on weekends.

## Next Steps
- Conduct a deeper analysis of crime types and their variations over the years.
- Explore external factors that might contribute to crime trends.
- Consider predictive modeling for future crime prediction.

## Acknowledgments
- This analysis relies on the Vancouver Police Department's crime data.
